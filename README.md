## Android Application: IEEE PEC Hackathon 2018

# Info Nearbyâ€¦ information on the go!

### About:

The application uses Google Firebase (BaaS) ML Kit to show details of various nearby objects as well as places. The ML Kit APIs are offered in two versions with certain trade-offs. The cloud-based version does require an Internet connection, but offers high accuracy, while the on-device version is less accurate and depends on the device's processing power, but can be used offline.

### Working:

1)	Image Labelling: Click a photograph of object to know about it by clicking on the camera button. Swipe up the screen to know its details or click on the picture to click another photograph.

2)	Landmark Detection: Click on the camera button to choose an image from mobile gallery. Swipe up to know its latitude-longitude and details.

### Future Enhancements:

The Landmark Detection feature only works for paid (Blaze) plan of Firebase using cloud based API. Other features like live information in video, face detector, text detector, image to text and code scanner can be added. Further custom models and dataset can be trained using TensorFlow to serve a specific purpose.
